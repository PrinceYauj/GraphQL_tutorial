# GraphQL_tutorial
A simple user - blog application which works with GraphQL queries and
mutations to provide CRUD operations with data. Data consists of 5
models: Users, Blogs, Posts, Comments and Reactions. All migrations
are written in SQL
 
The following technologies are used:

*   [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) as ORM;
*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as RDBMS;
*   [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) as DSL for tests;
*   [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as a query language
*   and also some other libraries which names can be found in `Gemfile`
    of the project.
